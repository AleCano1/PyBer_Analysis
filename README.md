# PyBer Analysis
PyBer is a ride-sharing app company, working in three city types: Urban, Suburban, and Rural. This analysis is about the relation between the type of city and the fare, drivers, and rides. 

## Overview of Project 
### Purpose 
The purpose is to analyze the total rides, total drivers, total fares, the average fares per drivers and the average fares per rides by each type of city, and how is the tendency of fares for each type of city weekly. Show it at multiple line chart and visualize in a kindful way the data and complete more information to make a decision based on a deep analyze always noticing the three types of cities and how the tendency change depending on this. 

## Results 
![pyber_summary_df](pyber_summary_df.png)
As we see in the table above, there are more total rides and total drivers in urban type, then in suburban-type and at the end in rural type. In spite of the fares being cheaper in urban-type as we saw before, we see now that there are more total fares in urban type, related with the rides and drivers. Also, we can observe that the average fare per ride is more expensive in rural type, a little bit more than suburban-type but $10 dollars more than urban type, comparing the average fare per driver the difference is bigger having rural type almost $16 dollars more expensive than suburban-type and almost $39 dollars more expensive than urban type. Considering the differences between rides and drivers, it is understood that rural city needs to elevate their fares to have profits.

Then in the line chart, we can see that the urban type having more drivers and rides as result have more total fares than the suburban type, being always between the urban and rural type, and at the end the rural type having less than $500.
Analyzing the lines, the urban type has the bigger fare at the end of February, having $2,500, then decreases a little bit and increases again at the beginning of March.
The suburban type has a fare between $700 and $1,500 having the top fare at the end of February.
The rural type has a fare between $100 and $500 having two increases, the bigger in April and the second at the end of February.
We can observe that at the end of February the three types of cities have an increase, this could be related with more rides. 

### Summary
First, I could recommend making another analysis, about the correlation between the drivers and rides in rural type, this could help to know where it is necessary to increase drivers based on rides.
Also, decrease drivers in urban type, analyze which cities have more drivers than rides because as we see in the summary DF urban type are the only type that has more drivers than rides, as a result, the average fare per driver is too low.
Finally, if we have the knowledge of why is the reason for the increases in fares, for example, vacations, the company could do a changed fare per season.
